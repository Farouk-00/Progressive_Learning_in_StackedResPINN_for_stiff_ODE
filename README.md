The repo has 3 repositories for three different exemples of Progressive Learning for stiff ODE :
  - the Van Der Poll Oscillator equation
  - The Lotka Voltera equation
  - The forced relaxation equation

Each repository has three codes to test the efficiency of the method :
  - One Vanilla PINN
  - And two stacked residual PINNs implemented with the Progressive Learning methodology
        • The first with adaptive gammas (the method the efficiency of which we want to prove)
        • The second one with constant gammas
